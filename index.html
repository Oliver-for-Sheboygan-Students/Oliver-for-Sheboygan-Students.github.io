              <p class="mt-3">
                Roger is a retired Army Infantry officer. He earned a bachelor of science at Cal Poly Pomona, California, an MBA from Syracuse University and a Masters of Theology from Dallas Theological Seminary. Roger and his wife, Marcy, lived and worked in Puebla, Mexico for 20 years where they founded a private K-12 learning center and are still involved in administration, funding and teaching.
              </p>
              <p>
                Roger Oliver, candidate for SASD (Sheboygan Area School District). Who controls education controls the future. Education is a family matter and a local endeavor. That means empowering parents, valuing students, and supporting teachers as individuals. Education must focus on developing the verbal and numeric skills to analyze and to make conclusions based on logic and evidence. 
              </p>
              <p>
                “We moved to Sheboygan in February, 2021, after 20+ years of ministry work in Puebla, Mexico. My wife, Marcy, has family in Kenosha, so Wisconsin was a natural fit. Friends from Sheboygan rented us an apartment above their house. It was God's calling us to this place and time. Since then, our widowed daughter and our son moved to Sheboygan from California. It is a blessing to have the family so close.”
              </p>
               <p>
                “Sheboygan is charming, mostly because of the wonderful people that Marcy and I have met. We began volunteering with Great Marriages and attend Grace OPC. I volunteered at the election polls three times in 2024. This is our home.”

Where we are failing, we should seek creative means to improve and review our policies to eliminate those that may be holding our students back or keeping talented and dedicated teachers from adapting to a child's needs.
